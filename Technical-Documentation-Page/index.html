        <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <article>
        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C
          programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++
          now has
          object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
          It is
          almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free
          Software
          Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

          C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and
          large
          systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been
          found
          useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained
          applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or
          databases), and
          performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).

          C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard
          version
          ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++
          programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the
          C++03,
          C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an
          enlarged
          standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist
          Bjarne
          Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible
          language
          similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.Since 2012, C++ is on a
          three-year
          release schedule, with C++23 the next planned standard.</p>

          <li>
            <h4>C++ vs. C#</h4>
            <p>
              As a much more modern programming language, C# was designed to work with the current Microsoft .NET
              framework in both
              client and web-based applications.

              While C++ is an object-oriented language, C# is considered a component-oriented programming language.
              Object-oriented
              programming concentrates on the associations between classes that link together into a big binary
              executable, while
              component-oriented programming uses exchangeable code modules that work on their own and don’t need you to
              know their
              inner workings to use them.

              Here are some other major differences between C++ and C#.

              C++ compiles into machine code, while C# compiles to CLR, which is interpreted by ASP.NET.
              C++ requires you to handle memory manually, but C# runs in a virtual machine which can automatically
              handle memory
              management.
              C# does not use pointers, while C++ can use pointers anywhere.
              C++ can be used on any platform, though it was originally designed for Unix-based systems. C# is
              standardized but is
              rarely used outside of Windows environments.
              C++ can create stand-alone and console applications. C# can create a console, Windows, ASP.NET, and mobile
              applications,
              but cannot create stand-alone apps.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>C vs. C++</h4>
            <p>
              To fully comprehend the differences between C and C++, you need an understanding of what object-oriented
              programming is.
              The term object-oriented, as it relates to programming, originated at MIT in the late 50s or early 60s.

              Object-oriented programming (or OOP) uses a concept called “objects.” An object is an instance of a
              “class,” or a
              program-code-template. A class can be made up of data or code procedures (also known as methods).
              The original C programming language is not object-oriented, which is the most significant difference
              between the two. C
              is what’s called a “procedural” programming language, while C++ is a hybrid language that’s a combination
              of procedural
              and object-oriented.

              There are other key differences between C and C++.

              C++ was built as an extension of C, which means it can run most C code. The reverse isn’t true though—C
              can’t run C++
              code.
              As an object-oriented language, C++ supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance, while C does
              not.
              In C, data and functions are “free entities,” which means you can manipulate them with outside code. Since
              C++
              encapsulates data and functions together into a single object, those data structures and operators are
              hidden to outside
              code.
              C++ uses the namespace, which organizes code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions. Name
              collisions can
              occur when your code base includes multiple libraries. C does not use a namespace.
              C uses functions for input and output, whereas C++ uses objects for input and output.
              C++ supports reference variables, which C does not. A reference variable is an alias for an already
              existing variable,
              used to create a short-hand notation for faster coding.
              C does not provide error or exception handling, but C++ does.</p>

        <h3>Hello World</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>In this example, we will learn to create a simple program named "Hello World" in C++ programming.</p>
        <p> A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello, World! on the screen.</p> Since it's a very simple
        program, it's
        often used to introduce a new programming language to a newbie.
        <p>Let's see how C++ "Hello, World!" program works.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        // Your First C++ Program

        #include &lt;iostream&gt;

        int main() 
        {
        std::cout &lt;&lt;"Hello World!" ;
        return 0; 
        } 
        </code></pre>
        <p>Output</p>

        <h3>Variables</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>The usefulness of the "Hello World" programs shown in the previous chapter is rather questionable. We had to
          write
          several lines of code, compile them, and then execute the resulting program, just to obtain the result of a
          simple
          sentence written on the screen. It certainly would have been much faster to type the output sentence
          ourselves.

          However, programming is not limited only to printing simple texts on the screen. In order to go a little
          further on and
          to become able to write programs that perform useful tasks that really save us work, we need to introduce the
          concept of
          variables.

          Let's imagine that I ask you to remember the number 5, and then I ask you to also memorize the number 2 at the
          same
          time. You have just stored two different values in your memory (5 and 2). Now, if I ask you to add 1 to the
          first number
          I said, you should be retaining the numbers 6 (that is 5+1) and 2 in your memory. Then we could, for example,
          subtract
          these values and obtain 4 as result.

        <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>The whole process described above is a simile of what a computer can do with two variables. The same process
          can be
          expressed in C++ with the following set of statements:
        <pre><code>
        a = 5;
        b = 2;
        a = a + 1;
        result = a - b;</code></pre>

        Obviously, this is a very simple example, since we have only used two small integer values, but consider that
        your
        computer can store millions of numbers like these at the same time and conduct sophisticated mathematical
        operations
        with them.

        We can now define variable as a portion of memory to store a value.

        Each variable needs a name that identifies it and distinguishes it from the others. For example, in the
        previous code
        the variable names were a, b, and result, but we could have called the variables any names we could have come
        up with,
        as long as they were valid C++ identifiers.

    <section id="Initialization_of_Variables" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h3>Initialization of Variables</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>When the variables in the example above are declared, they have an undetermined value until they are assigned
          a value
          for the first time. But it is possible for a variable to have a specific value from the moment it is declared.
          This is
          called the initialization of the variable.

          In C++, there are three ways to initialize variables. They are all equivalent and are reminiscent of the
          evolution of
          the language over the years:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first one, known as c-like initialization (because it is inherited from the C language), consists of
            appending an
            equal sign followed by the value to which the variable is initialized:</p>

            <pre><code>            type identifier = initial_value;</code></pre>
            <p>For example, to declare a variable of type int called x and initialize it to a value of zero from the
              same
              moment it is declared, we can write:</p>
            <pre><code>            int x = 0;</code></pre>

          </li>

          <li> A second method, known as constructor initialization (introduced by the C++ language), encloses the
            initial value between parentheses (()):

            <pre><code>
            type identifier (initial_value);
            </code></pre>
            <p>For example:</p>

            <pre><code>            int x (0);</code></pre>

          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, a third method, known as uniform initialization, similar to the above, but using curly braces
            <code>({})</code>
            instead of parentheses (this was introduced by the revision of the C++ standard, in 2011):
            <pre><code>
            type identifier {initial_value};
            </code></pre>
            <p>For example:</p>

            <pre><code>            int x {0};
            </code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>All three ways of initializing variables are valid and equivalent in C++.
            </p>
            <pre><code>            //initialization of variables</code></pre>

            <pre><code>            #include &lt;iostream&gt;
              
            using namespace std;
        
            int main ()
            {
            int a=5; // initial value: 5
            int b(3); // initial value: 3
            int c{2}; // initial value: 2
            int result; // initial value undetermined
        
            a = a + b;
            result = a - c;
            cout &lt;&lt; result;
            return 0; 
            }</code></pre>

        <h3>Fundamental Data Types</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>The values of variables are stored somewhere in an unspecified location in the computer memory as zeros and
          ones. Our
          program does not need to know the exact location where a variable is stored; it can simply refer to it by its
          name. What
          the program needs to be aware of is the kind of data stored in the variable. It's not the same to store a
          simple integer
          as it is to store a letter or a large floating-point number; even though they are all represented using zeros
          and ones,
          they are not interpreted in the same way, and in many cases, they don't occupy the same amount of memory.

          Fundamental data types are basic types implemented directly by the language that represent the basic storage
          units
          supported natively by most systems. They can mainly be classified into:
          Character types: They can represent a single character, such as 'A' or '$'. The most basic type is char, which
          is a
          one-byte character. Other types are also provided for wider characters.
          Numerical integer types: They can store a whole number value, such as 7 or 1024. They exist in a variety of
          sizes, and
          can either be signed or unsigned, depending on whether they support negative values or not.
          Floating-point types: They can represent real values, such as 3.14 or 0.01, with different levels of
          precision,
          depending on which of the three floating-point types is used.
          Boolean type: The boolean type, known in C++ as bool, can only represent one of two states, true or false.</p>

      <header>
        <h3>Constants</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>In C++, we can create variables whose value cannot be changed. For that, we use the const keyword. Here's an
          example:</p>
        <pre><code>
        const int LIGHT_SPEED = 299792458;
        LIGHT_SPEED = 2500 // Error! LIGHT_SPEED is a constant.</code></pre>

        <p> Here, we have used the keyword const to declare a constant named LIGHT_SPEED.</p>
        <p> If we try to change the value of
          LIGHT_SPEED, we will get an error.</p>

        <p>A constant can also be created using the #define preprocessor directive. We will learn about it in detail in
          the C++ Macros tutorial.</p>
      </article>

    <section id="if...else_if_statements" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h3>if...else if statements</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>In computer programming, we use the if statement to run a block code only when a certain condition is met.

          For example, assigning grades (A, B, C) based on marks obtained by a student.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            if the percentage is above 90, assign grade A </li>
          </li>
          <li>if the percentage is above 75, assign grade B </li>
          <li> if the percentage is above 65, assign grade C </li>
        </ul>
        There are three forms of if...else statements in C++.
        <ol>
          <li>if statement</li>
          <li>if...else statement</li>
          <li>if...else if...else statement</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>C++ if Statement</h4>
        The syntax of the if statement is:
        <pre><code>
        if (condition) {
        // body of if statement
        }
        </code></pre>
        The if statement evaluates the condition inside the parentheses ( ).
        <ul>
          <li> If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the body of if is executed.</li>
          <li> If the condition evaluates to false, the code inside the body of if is skipped.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Note: The code inside { } is the body of the if statement.</p>
        <h4> Working of C++ if Statement</h4>
        Example 1: C++ if Statement
        <pre><code>          // Program to print positive number entered by the user
          // If the user enters a negative number, it is skipped.
          #include &lt;iostream&gt;
          using namespace std;

          int main() {
          int number;

          cout &lt;&lt;"Enter an integer: ";
          cin &gt;&gt; number;

          // checks if the number is positive
        
          if (number > 0) {
          cout &lt;&lt; "You entered a positive integer: " &lt;&lt; number &lt;&lt; endl; 
         } 
          cout &lt;&lt;"This statement is always executed."; 
          return 0;
         }
        </code>
          </pre>Output 1
        <pre><code>          Enter an integer: 5 You entered a positive number: 5
          This statement is always executed.
        </code></pre>
        <p> When the user enters 5, the condition number &gt; 0 is evaluated to true and the statement inside the body
          of if
          is executed.</p>

        Output 2
        <pre><code>          Enter a number: -5
          This statement is always executed.
        </code></pre>

        <p> When the user enters -5, the condition number &gt; 0 is evaluated to false and the statement inside the body
          of
          if is not executed.</p>
        <h4>C++ if...else</h4>
        <p>The if statement can have an optional else clause. Its syntax is:</p>
        <pre><code>
        if (condition) {
        // block of code if condition is true
        }
        else {
        // block of code if condition is false
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p> The if..else statement evaluates the condition inside the parenthesis.</p>
        <h4>Working of if...else Statement</h4>

        <p>If the condition evaluates true,</p>
        <ul>
          <li> the code inside the body of if is executed </li>
          <li> the code inside the body of else is skipped from execution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the condition evaluates false,</p>
        <ul>
          <li> the code inside the body of else is executed</li>
          <li> the code inside the body of if is skipped from execution</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Functions</h3>

      <article>
        <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

          Suppose we need to create a program to create a circle and color it. We can create two functions to solve this
          problem:

          a function to draw the circle
          a function to color the circle
          Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reusable.

          There are two types of function:

          Standard Library Functions: Predefined in C++
          User-defined Function: Created by users
          In this tutorial, we will focus mostly on user-defined functions.

          C++ User-defined Function
          C++ allows the programmer to define their own function.

          A user-defined function groups code to perform a specific task and that group of code is given a name
          (identifier).

          When the function is invoked from any part of the program, it all executes the codes defined in the body of
          the
          function.</p>

        <p> C++ Function Declaration
          The syntax to declare a function is:</p>
        <pre><code>
        returnType functionName (parameter1, parameter2,...) {
        // function body
        }</code>
        </pre>
        <p> Here's an example of a function declaration.</p>

        <pre><code>
        // function declaration
        void greet() {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" ;
        }</code></pre>
        <p> Here, the name of the function is <code>greet()</code> the return type of the function is
          <code>void</code> the empty parentheses mean it doesn't have any parameters the function body is written
          inside.
