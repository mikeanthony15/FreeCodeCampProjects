        <h2 class="title-styles">Brief Biography</h2>
        <p class="biography-definition">Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in
          the 1870s without receiving
          a degree,
          gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new
          electric power
          industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a
          short time
          at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to
          finance and
          market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and
          mechanical
          devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by
          Westinghouse
          Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system
          which
          that company eventually marketed. Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted
          a range
          of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He
          also
          built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and
          demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship
          at public
          lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric
          power
          distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893,
          he made
          pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas
          to
          practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and
          power
          transmitter but ran out of funding before he could complete it. After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a
          series of
          inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived
          in a
          series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943 Tesla's work
          fell into
          relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named
          the SI
          unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla
          since the
          1990s.</p>

                Electrical and
                Electronics Engineers
                (IEEE) "for a career of
                meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the electrical arts." It is the
                oldest and most
                coveted medal in this field of engineering in the United States. The award consists of a gold medal,
                bronze replica,
                small gold replica, certificate and honorarium. The medal may only be awarded to a new leap/breakthrough
                in the
                technological area of science.

                annually to
                an individual or team
                that has made an
                outstanding contribution to the generation or utilization of electric power. It is awarded by the Board
                of
                Directors of
                the IEEE. The award is named in honor of Nikola Tesla. This award may be presented to an individual or a
                team.

                The award was established in 1975, and its first recipient was Leon T. Rosenberg, who was given the
                award
                in 1976 "for
                his half-century of development and design of large steam turbine driven generators and his important
                contributions to
                literature." The actual award is a plaque and honorarium.

                <h3 class="award-title">John Scott Award</h3>The John Scott Award is given to "the most deserving" men
                and women
                whose inventions have
                contributed in some
                outstanding way to the "comfort, welfare and happiness" of mankind.
                The donor, John Scott, was an Edinburgh druggist who in the early 1800s set up a fund calling upon the
                "Corporation of
                Philadelphia entrusted with the management of Dr. Franklin's legacy" to bestow upon "ingenious men or
                women who make
                useful inventions" a premium not to exceed twenty dollars and a suitably inscribed copper medal.

                Why Scott chose an American city to administer his bequest is not known, although it is believed he
                had a longstanding
                interest in America and appreciated the achievements of Benjamin Franklin.

                The first awards were made in 1822. Through the years, awards have been made internationally for the
                inventions in
                industry, agriculture, manufacturing, science, and medicine.

                Cresson Gold
                Medal, was the highest
                award given by the Franklin
                Institute. The award was established by Elliott Cresson, life member of the Franklin Institute, with
                $1,000 granted in
                1848. The endowed award was to be "for some discovery in the Arts and Sciences, or for the invention
                or improvement
                of some useful machine, or for some new process or combination of materials in manufactures, or for
                ingenuity skill or
                perfection in workmanship. The medal was first awarded in 1875, 21 years after Cresson's death.

                The Franklin Institute continued awarding the medal on an occasional basis until 1998 when they
                reorganized their
                endowed awards under one umbrella, The Benjamin Franklin Awards. A total of 268 Elliott Cresson Medals
                were given out
                during the award's lifetime.
